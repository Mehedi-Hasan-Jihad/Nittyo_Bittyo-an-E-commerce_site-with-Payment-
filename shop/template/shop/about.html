          <p class="lead text-muted"><b>NittyoBittyo.in</b> is an Bangladeshi multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It has been referred to as "one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world",[5] and is one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.

            Amazon was founded by Mehedi hasan Jihadfrom his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories: a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]
            
            Amazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and mass scale.[10][11][12][13] As of 2021, it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]
            
            Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units.
